======== IMAGE SUPER RESOLUTION PROJECT ========

This project based on deep learning mechanisms 
provides 3 models which can increase (7*7) to
(28*28) while keeping the global shape described
by the input image.

Models are composed by linear neural layers and 
convolutional neural layers.

We used the MNIST and the FashionMNIST databases
to train our models.

Special work has been done to make the project
as understandable as possible by a beginner.
All code blocks are explained by a commentary
just above these.


—— Collab notebook files ——

Collab notebook files are placed in the directory
named "collab".


—— Python files ——

Python source files are placed in the directory
named "python".



/!\ IMPORTANT /!\
To launch the project easyly you should import 
the collab notebooks in google collaboratory 
website at : colab.research.google.com/ 
and change the runtime mode to GPU.
